Install C++
If you want to run C++ on your own computer, you need two things:

A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand
There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In the next steps, we will show you how to use an IDE that includes both.
